@section The Neper Project

@subsection Description

Neper is a software package for polycrystal generation and meshing.  The polycrystals can be 2D or 3D. Neper is built around three modules:

@itemize @bullet
@item @MT{} generates polycrystals as tessellations.  The two main capabilities are: @emph{(i)} the generation of tessellations from cell properties (e.g.@ a size distribution) and @emph{(ii)} the generation of multiscale tessellations (i.e.@ including cell subdivisions).  These capabilities can also be used together.  Tessellations are Laguerre (or Voronoi) tessellations and are therefore composed of convex cells.  Finally, the tessellations can be ``regularized'' by removing their smallest features (edges and faces), which then enables good-quality meshing with @mM{}.  Periodicity conditions can be prescribed.  Crystal orientations are provided for the grains.  The output is a tessellation file written at a scalar (vectorial) or raster format.  Scalar tessellations are intended to be passed to modules -M and -V while raster tessellations can be used by FFT solvers.

@item @MM{} meshes polycrystals described as tessellation files. Two meshing techniques are available: free (or unstructured) meshing, which generates triangular elements (in 2D) or tetrahedral elements (in 3D) that follow the grain shapes, and mapped meshing, which generates regular, square elements (in 2D) or regular, cubic elements (in 3D) that do not necessarily follow the grain shapes.  Free meshing into good-quality elements is ensured by optimized meshing rules, and multimeshing---a complementary use of several meshing algorithms.  Remeshing is also available and is similar to meshing except that it takes a mesh as input.  Cohesive elements can be inserted at interfaces.  The output is a mesh file that can be written under several formats.

@item @MV{} generates publication-quality images of tessellations and meshes.  Colouring and transparency of the different entities can be set up in detail, and mesh nodes can be displaced.  Mesh slicing is also available.  The output is a PNG image file.
@end itemize

Neper aims to be an easy-to-use, efficient and robust tool.  All the input data are prescribed non-interactively, using command lines and / or ASCII files. All treatments can therefore be automated.

@subsection Resources and Support

Several, complementary resources describing Neper are available:

@itemize
@item The Neper reference manual, which is this document, describes all Neper's capabilities.  Each module is dedicated a specific chapter, which describes the available commands and result files, and provides examples.  The manual is available at the PDF and info formats.@footnote{Provided that the info file is properly installed at your site, it can be accessed by the command: @command{info neper}.}

@item The Neper website, @url{http://neper.info} gives a general introduction to Neper (including examples with illustrations) and is where Neper can be downloaded from.

@item The three Neper reference papers,
  @itemize
  @item ``@cite{R.@ Quey, P.R.@ Dawson and F.@ Barbe, Large-scale 3D random
  polycrystals for the finite element method: Generation, meshing and
  remeshing, Comput.@ Methods Appl.@ Mech.@ Engrg., vol.@ 200, pp.@
  1729-1745, 2011}'' describes the @w{regularization /} meshing
  methodologies.  It can be downloaded from the Neper homepage or directly
  from this link:
  @url{http://neper.info/docs/neper-reference-paper.pdf};

The best way to report bugs is directly through the GitHub issue tracker,
@url{http://github.com/rquey/neper/issues}.  When reporting bugs, please help
us helping you by providing a minimal working example.
@c
Neper also has two dedicated mailing lists (the GitHub issue tracker should be
preferred, especially for bug reports):
@c
@code{neper-announce}
(@url{https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/neper-announce}), the
``read-only'' list for release announcement
and @code{neper-users}
(@url{https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/neper-users}), the
``read-write'' list for users.
@c
As of October 2019, Neper also has an IRC channel, @url{#neper}, on the
@code{freenode} network.

@section Installing Neper

Neper is written in (mostly ANSI) C and a little C++, and it can run on any Unix-like system.  Neper is multithreaded (using openMP) and runs, by default, on all threads (as read in the @code{@var{OMP_NUM_THREADS}} environment variable).  Neper must be compiled using CMake, as follows:

@itemize
@item Create a @file{build} directory, for instance as a subdirectory of Neper's @file{src} directory,

@com{mkdir build}

@item Run CMake from within the @file{build} directory, pointing to Neper's
@file{src} directory,

@com{cd build}
@com{cmake ..}

@item Build Neper,

@com{make}

Use option @samp{-j} for a multithreaded compilation.

@item Install Neper on your system (as root),
@com{make install}

@end itemize

This procedure uses the default configuration options and should work out-of-the-box if the required dependencies are available in standard system locations.  If needed, a finer configuration can be achieved, before building Neper, by running

@comc{ccmake ..@ @ @ , (for a command-line tool)}

or

@comc{cmake-gui .., (for a graphical tool)}

Several of Neper's dependencies can be managed at this stage.  Some of them are optional and can be enabled or disabled through variables @code{HAVE_@var{LIBRARY}}:

@itemize

@item The GNU Scientific Library (GSL, mandatory).  It is likely to be available on your system or from your system package manager (binary and development packages); alternatively, the source code version can be downloaded from @uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl}.

@item The NLopt library (optional, enabled by default).  It is needed by @mT{} for tessellation generation from cell properties. It is likely to be available on your system or from your system package manager (binary and development packages); alternatively, the source code version can be downloaded from @uref{http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt}.

@item The OpenMP library (optional, enabled by default).  It is likely to be available on your system or from your system package manager.

@item The libScotch library (version @code{5.1.12} or higher, optional, disabled by default).  It is needed by @mM{} for mesh partitioning.  The source code can be downloaded from @url{www.labri.fr/perso/pelegrin/scotch}.

@item The pthread library (optional, enabled if libScotch enabled). It is needed if libScotch version @code{6.0.0} or higher is enabled.  It is likely to be available on your system or from your system package manager.

@end itemize

Other dependencies are needed at run time only (they are not linked against Neper's binary):

@itemize

@item The Gmsh program (version @code{2.4.2} or higher, excluding version @code{2.5.1}, mandatory for @mM{}). Both binary and source-code versions can be downloaded from @url{http://www.geuz.org/gmsh} (compiling from the source code significantly speeds up meshing).  Gmsh must be available at the terminal as the command @command{gmsh}, or the path to its binary must be specified with option @option{-gmsh} (in @mM{}).

@item The POV-Ray program (mandatory for module -V).  It is likely to be available on your system or from your system package manager (binary package); alternatively, a binary, or the source code, can be downloaded from @url{http://www.povray.org}.  POV-Ray must be available at the terminal as the command @command{povray}, or the path to its binary must be specified with option @option{-povray} (in @mV{}).

@end itemize

Neper has a few more dependencies, which are directly included in the source code (see directory @file{src/contrib}): nanoflann (@url{https://github.com/jlblancoc/nanoflann}) and muparser
(@url{http://beltoforion.de/article.php?a=muparser}).

Finally, the Neper installation can be tested out by
running
@com{make test}

or (equivalently)
@com{ctest}

@c Moreover, the documentation can be installed as an @file{info} file.  On
@c most systems, this can be achieved simply by copying the file
@c @file{neper.info} into an info directory (usually @file{/usr/info},
@c @file{/usr/local/info} or @file{/usr/doc/info}).

@section Getting Started

The @samp{neper} binary must be run in a terminal, followed by a list of arguments,

@com{neper @var{list_of_arguments}}

Neper returns messages in the terminal and results in ASCII files.

The list of arguments describes the problem to solve.  There are several
general-purpose, self-explanatory arguments:

@kindex --help
@kindex --version
@kindex --license
@com{neper --help}
@com{neper --version}
@com{neper --license}

This section provides information on how to call Neper's modules,
properly format option arguments, and set up an initialization file.

@subsection Modules

To call a module, run
@com{neper @var{module_name} @var{module_arguments}}

where the module name can be @option{-T}, @option{-M} or @option{-V}, and the module arguments can include both required input data and options.  Input data (when not a file name) and options start @w{by @samp{-}}.  Options can be provided in arbitrary order, each of them being followed by a single argument (containing no space).  American-english variants of options can be used.  String completion is available for all options, so they may be abbreviated as long as the abbreviation is not ambiguous. For instance, in module @code{-T}, option @option{-regularization} can be abbreviated to @option{-reg}.  Logical options can be enabled or disabled by providing argument @w{values of @samp{1}} @w{or @samp{0}}, respectively.  Integer or real argument values can be written as such, or as mathematical or logical expressions (for details, see @ref{Mathematical and Logical Expressions}).  For instance, in @mT{}, option @option{@w{-rcl 0.5}} can also be written as @option{@w{-rcl 1/2}} or @option{@w{-rcl "cos(pi/3)"}}.  @MV{} shows some exceptions with respect to these rules: the argument cannot be listed in arbitrary order, string completion is not available, and option @option{-loop} takes several arguments.

@subsection Argument Separators

Some options may take several argument values.  These values can be combined using @dfn{separators} (see @ref{Tessellation Module (-T)}, @ref{Meshing Module (-M)} and @ref{Visualization Module (-V)} for details on each option).  There are three possible separators:

@itemize
@item The @samp{@SEPNODEP} separator combines uncorrelated arguments, i.e.@ arguments of the same type, which can be processed independently from each other.  Such arguments can be output file formats, for instance.

@item The @samp{@SEPDEP} separator is used to combine correlated arguments, i.e.@ arguments of different types, which cannot be processed independently from each other.  Such arguments can be values of a variable in different directions, for instance.

@item The @samp{::} separator is used in @mT{} (and a little in @mM{}) for assigning argument values to the different scales of a multiscale tessellation.  It is a ``super-separator'' that takes precedence over the @samp{@SEPNODEP} and @samp{@SEPDEP} standard separators.

@end itemize

@subsection Initialization File

When Neper is run, it starts by reading commands from an initialization file, @file{$HOME/.neperrc}, if that file exists.  Another initialization file can be specified with option @option{--rcfile}, before calling a module,

@com{neper --rcfile @var{my_file} @var{module_name module_arguments}}

To disable the reading of an initialization file, use option @option{--rcfile none}.

When a module of Neper is called, Neper looks for the occurrence of @samp{neper @var{module_name}} in the initialization file and then reads all arguments until the next occurrence of @samp{neper} (which should denote the beginning of another module option field) or the end of the file.  The arguments may be any legal arguments but are typically limited to frequently-used options.  Moreover, any field of comments can be preceded by @samp{neper comments}.

@c @medskip
Here is an example of initialization file:

@c @cartouche
@example
@c @group
neper comments ------------------------------------------------------
This is my initialization file.
neper -T -reg 1
neper -M -gmsh my_gmsh_path
neper comments ------------------------------------------------------
@c @end group
@end example
@c @end cartouche

@c @medskip
If the initialization file is not found, or if @samp{neper @var{module_name}} is not found inside it, Neper will consider only the command line arguments.  Also, if an argument is initialized several times (for instance, both in the initialization file and at the command line), only the last specified value is used.

@section Reading this Manual

This manual is maintained as a Texinfo manual.  Here are the writing conventions used in the document:

@itemize
@item A command that can be typed in a terminal is printed like @command{this}, or, in the case of a major command, like

@comc{this,;}

@item A program (or command) option is printed like @option{this};
@item The name of a variable is printed like @code{this};
@item A meta-syntactic variable (i.e.@: something that stands for another piece of text) is printed like @var{this};
@item Literal examples are printed like @samp{this};
@item File names are printed like @file{this}.
@end itemize

Module arguments are tagged by type and importance level:

@itemize
@item Prerequisites are tagged @w{`[Prerequisite]'}---they should be
placed in the initialization file;
@item Input data are tagged @w{`[Input Data]'};
@item Standard options are tagged @w{`[Option]'};
@item Secondary options, which should be used only for fine-tuning and
if you really know what you are doing, are tagged @w{`[Secondary option]'};
@item Post-processing options are tagged @w{`[Post-processing]'}.
@end itemize

Some abbreviations are used consistently for options and contribute to Neper's
jargon:
