New in 1.10.0 (04 June 2012):
- General: New (hopefully simpler) installation procedure based on Cmake.
  Added support for domains of any convex polyhedral shape.
- module -VS: major code rewriting and option changes. New capabilities
  for defining the colours and sizes of the tessellation / mesh
  (including gradients).  Added options to show only specific parts of the
  tessellation / mesh and to view slices of a mesh. Other small
  enhancements.

  (cuboidal, cylindrical or of any convex shape), small bug fixes, added
  centroid Voronoi tessellation generation (option -centroid), merged
  option -centrecoo into option -morpho, added polyhedron centroid
  coordinates in file .stt3, changed option -load to -loadtess, added
  output format `.ply' (thanks Ehsan!).
- module -FM: mesh partitionning needs libscotch version 5.1.12 or later,
  small bug fixes, changed default value of -faset to "" (i.e. no faset
  in output), fixed bug for Abaqus output, added polyhedron centroid
  coordinates in file .stt3, added output format `.ply' (geometry only).
- module -MM: new options -dsize and -scale, new option -loadmesh, new
  option -outdim, changed arguments of -ttype, changed default value of
  -faset to "" (i.e. no faset in output), fixed bug for Abaqus output,
  small bug fixes.

- module -T: added option -morpho for specifying the type of grain
  structure (equiaxed, columnar or bamboo), merged option -regular
  with -morpho, added post-processing -neighbour option for information
  on the polyhedron neighbours, added geo (Gmsh geometry) output format
  (mostly for visualization), fixed bugs.
- module -MM: proper processing of the input tess files, added msh
  (Gmsh) and inp (Abaqus) output formats, added options -morpho and
  -centrecoo (as in module -T), small bug fixes, code cleaning.
- module -FM: added geo (Gmsh geometry) output format (mostly for
  visualization), small bug fixes.
- documentation: small corrections.

New in 1.9.1 (May 2011):
- module -FM: fixed bug occurring when -mesh3dalgo is not set by the
  user.  Small other bug fixes.
- module -MM: small bug fixes.

New in 1.9.0 (Apr 2011):
This is a major release.  Neper now has its own paper:
"R.Quey, P.R. Dawson and F. Barbe.  Large-scale 3D random polycrystal
 for the finite element method: Generation, meshing and remeshing.
 Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering,
 Vol. 200, pp. 1729--1745, 2011."
Please cite it in your works if you use Neper.
- General: added option --rcfile to disregard / change the
  initialization file; big distribution and source clean up; bug fixes.
- module -T: added capability to generate regular morphologies
  (truncated octahedra), tess file format bumped to 1.9; big clean up.
- module -FM: included multimeshing, remeshing and mesh partitioning
  capabilities; big clean up.  Neper now uses the *standard* Gmsh
  distribution for 2D and 3D meshings (versions >=2.4.2).  Strongly
  reduced memory usage.
- module -O: added capability to handle different orientation
  descriptors.
- module -VS: new visualization module to generate publication-quality
  images (PNG format) of the tessellations, meshes and more...

New in 1.8.1 (Aug 2009):
- upgraded website at http://neper.sourceforge.net
- module -T: new file format ***tess1.8, new option -restart to load an
  existing tessellation (not through std input any more), new option
  -printformat, bug fixes.
- module -MM: bug fixes.
- module -FM: new output format mae, new option -restart to restart from
  an existing geometry or mesh (options -mesh and -conv removed); new
  options -printformat and -maeextension; better mesh numbering (+ new
  options -elementfirstid and -nodefirstid), new way to choose the node
  sets to output (-nset 4), fixed option -estat, renamed -bwcy-clmin to
  -clmin, cleaned bunch of options, bug fixes.
- module -O: added option -euleranglesconvention (Bunge, Roe & Kocks);
  new output formats mae and geof (option -format).
